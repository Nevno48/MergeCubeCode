There are multiple window that are opened. There is the text editor and the command line. 
The process that the file undergoes before it is put on git’s database(repository) is a s follows:
Working Directory/computer(holds files) → staging area → repository
Commands

-git init (repository): this is used to make a new Git repository
-git status: this shows the contents of the staging area(files that are worked on, but not added to the repository) and the working directory
-git add (filename): adds the file to the staging area
-git diff (filename): shows the changelog of differences made of the file
-git commit (filename): puts the file from the staging area to the repository
-git log: shows all the list of commits; press q to get out of log text

-git checkout HEAD (filename): discards changes in the working directory
-git reset HEAD (filename): unstages file from the staging area
-git commit log: shows the log of commits to files
-git reset commit (first 7 digits of code attached to commit change): this commits to a previous version of the file.

Branching: allows different versions of a project to be saved

-git branch: lists all the branches
-git branch (name of branch): creates a new branch
-git checkout (branch name): switches branch to new branch called branch name
-git merge (branch name): adds files from the branch branch name to the branch you are on
-git branch -d (branch name): deletes branch called branch name

Communicating using Git remotes

-git clone (remote location/name) (clone file name): clones remote location into working directory called clone file name
-git remote -v: lists all remotes in folder name in working directory
-git fetch (file name): fetches file filename from remote into working directory
-git merge (origin)/(master): merges origin with master remote
-git push (remote name) (your branch name): puts your branch into the remote’s branch
